## About The Project

PhotoStorage is a product designed to keep your photos all in one place, with the usage of animation to make the storages part feel engage and interest for users.

## Reason
As a user, I want to share images with friends and family, like images I enjoy, and hide images I don't want to see in the future, so that I can have a personalized and enjoyable experience with the content that matters to me.
